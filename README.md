# Rats

This project is an exploration of functional typeclasses in `rust` using generic associative types. This implements The functor hierarchy between `Functor` and `Monad`, and some implementations for `Option`, `Vec`, and `Result`. There's also a `Semigroup` and `Monoid`.

 Why `rats`? I'm used to `cats` from the Scala world. So it's like `cats`, but for `rust` - hence `rats`.
